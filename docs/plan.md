# Project Plan

## Risk Analysis (TAME Framework)

### Technical Risks
- Risk: Problems publishing the website on GitHub Pages.  
  Mitigation: Follow GitHub Pages setup guides and test early.  
- Risk: CSS styling may not display as intended.  
  Mitigation: Keep design simple and test in different browsers.  

### Acceptance Risks
- Risk: Website may not look professional enough.  
  Mitigation: Focus on readability and clear layout instead of advanced design.  

### Management Risks
- Risk: Running out of time before finishing.  
  Mitigation: Create a simple timeline with small, achievable tasks.  
- Risk: Forgetting to update documents as website develops.  
  Mitigation: Review repository before submission to confirm all documents are included.  

### External Risks
- Risk: Internet or computer problems.  
  Mitigation: Back up files regularly and work early to allow extra time.
