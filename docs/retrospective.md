# Project Retrospective

## What Went Well
- The project scope was clear from the beginning, which made it easier to stay focused.  
- Setting up the GitHub repository and organizing the folder structure was simple and worked smoothly.  
- Creating the two-page prototype with basic HTML and CSS went well because the design was kept simple.  
- Publishing the website using GitHub Pages was successful, and the site was live without major issues.  

## What Went Wrong
- Writing the project documents took longer than expected, especially the project plan and risk analysis.  
- Styling the website with CSS required extra adjustments because some elements did not look the same in different browsers.  
- At first, it was confusing to remember that the retrospective is about my process of building the proposal package, not about the fictional website itself.  

## What I Would Do Differently
- Start writing the documentation earlier so there is more time for editing and improving the documents.  
- Plan the CSS styling on paper before coding, which would make the design process smoother.  
- Test GitHub Pages earlier in the process instead of waiting until the end.  
- Spend more time making the README.md more descriptive and professional to better explain the proposed website project.  

## Overall Reflection
This project helped me bring together project management, documentation, and web development skills. Even though the website prototype was simple, it supported the proposal package and demonstrated the process of planning, building, and reflecting on a digital project. This experience gave me more confidence in using GitHub, writing clear documents, and managing small projects step by step.
